# Blockchain Project
Blockchain server, mining server and proof-of-work via python power

# Aims and Goals
The purpose of this project is to make an open-source Blockchain project and to learn this technology. This blockchain infrastructure can fit the project you want. The project includes important cryptological issues such as public and private keys and changes, SSL / TLS issues. At the same time, multiprocessing and multithreading issues are mentioned in the mining parts.

# Blockchain 
Blockchain technology would help in verifying the integrity of patient data shared across different organizations, create immutable audit trails for data governing health care business processes, and maintain the integrity of data collected in clinical health trials. Blockchains can increase security on three fronts: blocking identity theft, preventing data tampering, and stopping Denial of Service attacks.

Blockchain is more about guaranteeing the integrity of data rather than keeping data private, it’s not likely to reduce data breaches, but it could prevent — or in some cases, eliminate — tampering types of attack.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a popular form of public key cryptography that secures emails, messaging apps, websites, and other forms of communication. However because most implementations of PKI rely on centralized, trusted third party Certificate Authorities (CA) to issue, revoke, and store key pairs for every participant, hackers can compromise them to spoof user identities and crack encrypted communications.
